= Inventories and Items

This page doesn't just describe the inventory itself,
but also everything else that is used by it.

== Item Descriptor [.title-ref]#(`UFGItemDescriptor`)#

The native `AFGItemDescriptor` class, who would have thought, describes
an Item itself. It holds information like:

* {blank}
Name::
  The actual displayed name to the user
* {blank}
+
Description::
  A description of the item itself. Most of the time it contains
  information about its usage but also some useless information.
* {blank}
+
Inventory Icon::
  The icon you can see in your inventory is no live rendering of the
  item, instead, it's just a simple image file.
* {blank}
+
Conveyor Model::
  This is a Static Mesh used to display the item in world and for use by the xref::/Development/Satisfactory/ConveyorRendering.adoc[Conveyor Rendering] system.
* {blank}
+
Radioactive Decay::
  Some items like Uranium Ore cause radiation damage to the player when nearby. This field stores information about the radiation emitted by the item.
* {blank}
+
Energy value (for use as Fuel)::
  Different items have different amounts of energy storage when used as
  fuel. Coal, for example, has less energy than Packaged Fuel when used in a vehicle.

[TIP]
====
Sometimes you don't need to define all of these fields. For example, when you want to
create a building descriptor, you won't need a model for conveyors or an
energy value cause you don't want to throw a building into a generator or move buildings around on belts.

== Item [.title-ref]#(`FInventoryItem`)#

This structure contains information about a item (class pointer to a item descriptor) and its connected item state (any kind of actor).

== ItemAmount [.title-ref]#(`FItemAmount`)#

This struct connects just a item descriptor and a count of items without a state.
That means, this structure is not used to hold information the representation of a item ingame.
Instead this is f.e. use in a recipe to define how many items of what type of item you need to bring up to get some different type of item with a different amount of them.

== ItemStack [.title-ref]#(`FItemStack`)#

This is the brother of ItemAmount but this time it holds a Item and a count.
That means, this time, it is actually used to hold information about item and its count ingame.
F.e. how many items of what kind are in one player inventory slot?

== FGInventoryComponent [.title-ref]#(`UFGInventoryComponent`)#

This is a `USceneComponent` used to attach a inventory, able to hold multiple Item Stacks at the same time, to a actor. This is not only used for the player, its nearly always used were you know there are items inside.
That means you can think of them like a container full of items.
